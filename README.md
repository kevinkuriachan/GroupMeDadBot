# This is a fun little side project to learn the GroupMe API and learn how to use Heroku.
## At the moment, there are three things the bot can do:
- Echo back what anyone says.
- Mock a specific person or persons in a chat.
- Respond "Hi [phrase], I'm Dad." When anyone says something in the format " ... I'm [phrase]. "
#### The reason there are so many commits to this repo is that I have to get the changes to the server by pushing it in order to test the bot.
####Bots are written in a class structure and each bot gets its own route in Flask.
