# This is a fun little side project to learn the GroupMe API and learn how to use Heroku.
## At the moment, there are three things the bot can do:
- Echo back what anyone says.
- Mock a specific person or persons in a chat.
- Respond "Hi [phrase], I'm Dad." When anyone says something in the format " ... I'm [phrase]. "

- There is one userful bot though, HowdyBot. It lives in the group chat for my dorm and whenever someone joins, it welcomes them and asks who their peer mentor is and what floor they are on. 

#### The reason there are so many commits to this repo is that I have to get the changes to the server by pushing it in order to test the bot.
####Bots are written in a class structure and each bot gets its own route in Flask.
